## My comments after first version

I have done it(and that is a good information), but I realize that the quality of code is not the best(speaking gently). This project gave ma a lot of 
precious expernies, I can say this is a small(and first) step to understand React. Despite of code quality I decide to push this project on gh as the first working application build with React.
